# Slinky react-router-native
Refactoring of [react-router-native basic example](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/native/example/Basic) coded in [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) through [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org), [Slinky](https://slinky.dev), [ScalablyTyped](https://github.com/oyvindberg/ScalablyTyped) and [Expo](https://expo.io).

## How to
### Build the app
Make sure you have SBT and NPM installed.

Once you've created your project, first compile your Scala code to JavaScript by running
```sh
sbt fastOptJS
```

Then, launch the app with Expo
```sh
npm start
```

## Contribute

Help is needed, with the aim of mapping 100% of the react-router-native demo features.
